  <h1>Privacy Policy</h1>
  <p><strong>Effective date:</strong> May 20, 2025</p>

  <h2>1. Introduction</h2>
  <p>
    At Countus ("we", "our", or "us"), your privacy is our priority. This Privacy Policy outlines how we manage information when you use our mobile application, Countus (the "App"). The App is designed to function entirely offline, ensuring minimal data collection and maximum user control. By downloading, installing, or using the App, you agree to the practices described in this policy. If you do not agree, please refrain from using the App.
  </p>

  <h2>2. Controller</h2>
  <p>
    The entity responsible for overseeing the data practices of the App is:
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Name:</strong> Countus App Development Team</li>
    <li><strong>Contact Email:</strong> <a href="mailto:tugberktabak@yahoo.com">tugberktabak@yahoo.com</a></li>
    <li><strong>Address:</strong> Not publicly disclosed; please use email for all inquiries.</li>
  </ul>
  <p>
    As the data controller, we ensure that any data handling complies with applicable privacy regulations, although our minimal data practices reduce the need for extensive oversight.
  </p>

  <h2>3. Information We Collect</h2>
  <p>
    The App is designed to prioritize your privacy by limiting data collection to only what is necessary for its core functionality. Below is a detailed breakdown of the information we handle:
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li>
      <strong>Local Usage Data:</strong> The App stores counters and labels you create (e.g., names or numbers for tracking purposes). This data is saved locally on your device using React Native’s <em>AsyncStorage</em>, a secure, device-specific storage mechanism. No data is transmitted to external servers or cloud services.
    </li>
    <li>
      <strong>No Personal Data:</strong> We do not collect or process any personally identifiable information, including but not limited to your name, email address, phone number, contact lists, location, or payment details.
    </li>
    <li>
      <strong>Device Information:</strong> The App does not access or collect device-specific information, such as unique device identifiers (e.g., IMEI, UDID), IP addresses, operating system details, or hardware specifications.
    </li>
    <li>
      <strong>No Third-Party Analytics or Tracking:</strong> We do not integrate or use third-party analytics, advertising, marketing, or tracking services (e.g., Google Analytics, Firebase). The App operates independently of external data collection tools.
    </li>
  </ul>

  <h2>4. Legal Basis for Data Processing</h2>
  <p>
    Since the App does not collect, store, or process personal data as defined by global privacy regulations (e.g., General Data Protection Regulation [GDPR], California Consumer Privacy Act [CCPA]), we do not rely on legal bases such as consent, legitimate interest, or contractual necessity. The minimal, non-personal data stored locally is solely for the App’s functionality and remains under your control.
  </p>

  <h2>5. Purpose of Data Processing</h2>
  <p>
    The sole purpose of storing data in the App is to enable its core functionality, such as creating, managing, and displaying counters or labels. This data:
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li>Is used exclusively to provide the App’s features to you.</li>
    <li>Is not shared, sold, or disclosed to any third parties.</li>
    <li>Is not used for profiling, marketing, or any purpose beyond the App’s intended use.</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>6. Data Retention</h2>
  <p>
    All data created within the App (e.g., counters and labels) is stored locally on your device and remains there until you take action to remove it. Specifically:
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li>Data persists until you manually delete it within the App or uninstall the App, which clears all associated data.</li>
    <li>We do not maintain backups, copies, or archives of your data on external servers or databases.</li>
    <li>If you reinstall the App, previously stored data may not be recoverable unless preserved by your device’s backup system (e.g., iCloud, Google Backup), which is outside our control.</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>7. User Rights</h2>
  <p>
    Since the App does not process personal data, many traditional data subject rights do not apply. However, we provide full transparency and control over the data you create within the App:
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li>
      <strong>Access & Portability:</strong> Not applicable, as no personal data is stored. You can view all counters and labels directly within the App’s interface.
    </li>
    <li>
      <strong>Rectification & Erasure:</strong> You can edit or delete any counters or labels at any time using the App’s built-in features. Uninstalling the App removes all data.
    </li>
    <li>
      <strong>Restriction & Objection:</strong> Not applicable, as no data is processed or shared externally.
    </li>
    <li>
      <strong>Withdraw Consent:</strong> Not applicable, as no consent is required for local, non-personal data storage.
    </li>
    <li>
      <strong>Complaints:</strong> If you have concerns about our data practices, you may contact us (see Section 13) or, if applicable, lodge a complaint with a data protection authority in your jurisdiction.
    </li>
  </ul>

  <h2>8. Security</h2>
  <p>
    We take reasonable steps to protect the data stored locally on your device:
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Storage Security:</strong> Data is stored using React Native’s <em>AsyncStorage</em>, which leverages secure, device-native storage mechanisms.</li>
    <li><strong>No Network Transmission:</strong> Since the App operates offline, there is no risk of data interception during transmission.</li>
    <li><strong>Device Responsibility:</strong> You are responsible for securing your device (e.g., using a PIN, password, biometric lock, or encryption) to prevent unauthorized access to App data. We cannot protect against physical access to an unlocked device.</li>
  </ul>
  <p>
    While we implement standard security practices, no method of storage is completely secure. We encourage you to maintain up-to-date device security software and settings.
  </p>

  <h2>9. Third-Party Services</h2>
  <p>
    The App is entirely self-contained and does not connect to external servers, APIs, or third-party services. All operations, including data storage and processing, occur locally on your device. We do not embed or rely on third-party libraries or frameworks that collect data.
  </p>

  <h2>10. International Users and Data Transfers</h2>
  <p>
    Since the App does not transmit or store data externally, there are no cross-border data transfers. The App’s offline nature ensures compliance with international privacy laws without the need for data transfer agreements or mechanisms.
  </p>

  <h2>11. Children’s Privacy</h2>
  <p>
    The App is not designed or marketed for users under 13 years of age (or the equivalent age in your jurisdiction, e.g., 16 under GDPR for certain regions). We do not knowingly collect or process data from children. If you are a parent or legal guardian and believe a child under 13 has used the App, please contact us immediately at <a href="mailto:tugberktabak@yahoo.com">tugberktabak@yahoo.com</a>. We will take steps to ensure any such data is deleted, though this may simply involve advising you to uninstall the App on the child’s device.
  </p>

  <h2>12. Changes to This Policy</h2>
  <p>
    We may revise this Privacy Policy to reflect updates to our practices, technological changes, or legal requirements. Changes will be communicated by:
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li>Updating the "Effective date" at the top of this document.</li>
    <li>Posting the revised policy within the App or on our official website (if applicable).</li>
  </ul>
  <p>
    Your continued use of the App after the effective date of any changes constitutes acceptance of the updated policy. We encourage you to review this policy periodically.
  </p>
